; eAccelerator is compatible with Zend Optimizer's loader. Zend Optimizer
; must be installed after eAccelerator in php.ini. If you don't use scripts
; encoded with Zend Encoder then we do not recommend you install Zend Optimizer
; with eAccelerator.


; You must uncomment one (and only one) line from the following to load
; eAccelerator extension.
extension="eaccelerator.so"
;zend_extension="/usr/lib/php/modules/eaccelerator.so"
;zend_extension_ts="/usr/lib/php/modules/eaccelerator.so"

; The amount of shared memory (in megabytes) that eAccelerator will use.
; "0" means OS default. Default value is "0".
eaccelerator.shm_size = "8"

; The directory that is used for disk cache. eAccelerator stores precompiled
; code, session data, content and user entries  here. The same data can be
; stored in shared memory also (for more quick access). Default value is
; "/tmp/eaccelerator".
eaccelerator.cache_dir = "/opt/tmp/eaccelerator"

; Enables or disables eAccelerator. Should be "1" for enabling or
; "0" for disabling. Default value is "1".
eaccelerator.enable = "1"

; Enables or disables internal peephole optimizer which may speed up code
; execution. Should be "1" for enabling or "0" for disabling.
; Default value is "1".
eaccelerator.optimizer = "1"

; Enables or disables debug logging. Setting this to 1 will print information
; to the log file about the cach hits of a file.
eaccelerator.debug = 0

; Set the log file for eaccelerator. When this option isn't set then the data
; will be logged to stderr
eaccelerator.log_file = "/opt/var/log/eaccelerator.log"

; A string that's prepended to all keys. This allows two applications that use the
; same key names to run on the same host by setting this in .htaccess or in the main
; configuration file for the whole webserver.
eaccelerator.name_space = ""

; Enables or disables PHP file modification checking. Should be "1"
; for enabling or "0" for disabling. You should set it to "1" if you want
; to recompile PHP files after modification. Default value is "1".
eaccelerator.check_mtime = "1"

; Determine which PHP files must be cached. You may specify the number of
; patterns (for example "*.php *.phtml") which specifies to cache or
; not to cache. If pattern starts with the character "!", it means to ignore
; files which are matched by the following pattern. Default value is "" that
; means - all PHP scripts will be cached.
eaccelerator.filter = ""

; When eAccelerator fails to get shared memory for new script it removes 
; all scripts which were not accessed at last "shm_ttl" seconds from shared
; memory. Default value is "0" that means - don't remove any files from
; shared memory.
eaccelerator.shm_ttl = "0"

; When eAccelerator fails to get shared memory for new script it tries to 
; remove old script if the previous try was made more then "shm_prune_period"
; seconds ago. Default value is "0" that means - don't try to remove any
; files from shared memory.
eaccelerator.shm_prune_period = "0"

; Enables or disables caching of compiled scripts on disk. It has no effect
; on session data and content caching.
; Default value is "0" that means - use disk and shared memory for caching.
eaccelerator.shm_only = "0"

; The script paths that are allowed to get admin information and do admin
; controls
